 * Purpose: This program asks the user to enter an objectâ€™s mass, and 
 * then calculates and displays its weight. If the object weighs more than
 * 1,000 newtons, a message indicating that it is too heavy. If the 
 * object weighs less than 10 newtons, a message indicating that the 
 * object is too light.
